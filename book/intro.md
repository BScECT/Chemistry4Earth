# Chemistry for Earth Sciences

## Course description

Chemistry for Earth Sciences will extend what you know from chemistry in high-school to what you need as an engineer in Earth, Climate & Technology. The topics that are addressed in this course are taken from aqueous chemistry, geochemistry, mineralogy, atmospheric chemistry and environmental chemistry. The content covers both equilibrium and non-equilibrium reactions in homogeneous phase systems (liquid, solids, gas), as well as reactions in heterogeneous systems containing mixtures of solids, liquids and gases. In these heterogeneous systems, reactions across interfaces are important. The course is based on a quantitative approach where the underlying mathematics are important so that students can understand and apply these concepts in a modeling framework. 

The content will expand the knowledge from high-school on acid-base chemistry, redox-chemistry, chemical thermodynamics, phase-diagrams, equilibrium and non-equilibrium chemistry, and the understanding of chemical compounds to the context of earth sciences.

## What to expect?
This Jupyter book provides the road map for the course. All activities are introduced in the following chapters and there are a number of assignments you need to do. The didactic approach is based on guided tutorials where you study and practice the material yourself. The amount of lectures is kept to a minimum. In order to benefit most from this style of learning we urge you to prepare each lecture. We have scheduled time for this preparation in the time planner.

Each week at the end of the practial we will have a short assignment at exam level so you can assess your performance along the way.

Brightspace will be used for providing day to day information relevant to this course. The schedule is published there and you will be able to find material to prepare a Python environment for this course on your own computer. You sometimes need to download notebooks from this Jupyter-book to do certain assignments. Sometimes we will ask you to submit these notebooks to Brightspace so we can assess your performance. All test exams need to be submitted to Brightspace as well. Please note these tests are formative.
