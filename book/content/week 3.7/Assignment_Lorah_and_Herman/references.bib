              outgassing and calcite precipitation or dissolution control the chemical evolution of the stream. The observed chemical composition of the water was used with the computerized geochemical model WATEQF to calculate aqueous speciation, saturation indices, and CO

              partial pressure values. Mass balance calculations were performed to obtain mass transfers of CO

              and calcite. Reaction times, estimated from stream discharge, were used with the mass transfer results to calculate rates of CO

              , outgassing and calcite precipitation between consecutive sampling points. The stream, which is fed by a carbonate spring, is supersaturated with respect to CO

              along the entire 5.2‐km flow path. Outgassing of CO
              2
              drives the solution to high degrees of supersaturation with respect to calcite. Metabolic uptake of CO
              2
              by photosynthetic plants is insignificant, because the high supply rate of dissolved carbon dioxide and the extreme agitation of the stream at waterfalls and rapids causes a much greater amount of inorganic CO

              outgassing to occur. Calcite precipitation is kinetically inhibited until near the crest of a 20‐m vertical waterfall. Calcite precipitation rates then reach a maximum at the waterfall where greater water turbulence allows the most rapid escape of CO
              2
              . Physical evidence for calcite precipitation exists in the travertine deposits which are first observed immediately above the waterfall and extend for at least 1.0 km below the falls. Net calcite precipitation occurs at all times of the year but is greatest during low‐flow conditions in the summer and early fall.},
