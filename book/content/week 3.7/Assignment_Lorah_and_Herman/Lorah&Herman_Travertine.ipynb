    "## Unravelling the geochemistry of Travertine deposition along a stream\n",
    "In the paper by Lorah and Herman (1988) you will see that several sampling trips were made to collect samples along a stream moving away from the hotsprings where the stream originates, past a waterfall and then further down stream. In Table 1, analysis results are presented for to sampling campaigns, one on 14 October 1984 and another on 6  April 1985. We will use these data for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the analysis is to increase our understanding of the formation of travertine deposits along the stream and especially near the water fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis you will do follows the approach given in the paper and consists in principle of two main steps:\n",
    "1. We use that analysis results from the table to assess the the most likely in-situ conditions at the moment of sampling. The analysis results, give totals of the elements expressed as shown in the header of the table. The true speciation will vary, elements will be present in other forms as well, solid minerals may control the composition of the water, but are not sampled with the water. The system may, or may not be in equilibrium. We analyse this problem with Orchestra using an Chemistry input file where we give the total of all measured compounds as master species, and we do not allow any minerals to precipitate, but we do report the SI-values for those minerals.\n",
    "2. After doing the first analysis, we have quite alot of additional information compared to the chemical analysis results from the lab, we know partial $\\text{CO}_2[g]$ pressure and the SI-values for possible minerals for the water samples along the river. It is safe to assume that water down stream from the spring originated from the spring and that its composition should be realated to the water at the spring. With this assumption we can use Orchestra to simulate changes related to the measurements obtained above. For example: if we have water from S-1 and move this to the conditions at D-3 ($\\text{CO}_2[g]$ pressure and Calcite-SI), how much calcite would have precipitated in between?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Orchestra you define the type of calculation you want to do with a *chemistry.inp* file. For this assignment we need two types:\n",
    "1. To calculate the equilibrium calculations for our system without allowing minerals to precipitate;\n",
    "2. As similar input file, but where we allow the minerals to precipitate. As we want to compare samples along the line, we also need to be able to control the SI-value which is used to achieve the equilibrium. Normally, the SI-value is assumed to be zero for supersaturated samples, in this assignment we need to allow the model to equilibrate assuming higher, or even lower SI-values. In addition, the $\\text{CO}_2[g]$ pressure needs to be fixed as well, which we can achieve by fixing the CO2[g].logact.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise} **Assumptions**\n",
    "As stated above, we assume that the composition of the water downstream of the spring is closely related to the composition of the water at the stream. Please carefully evaluate this assumption and try to find reasons why this assumption might not be true? What can you do to mitigate the reasons you found?\n",

    "For this first step I have already prepared an Orchestra input file using the *orchestra2026.jar* Graphical User Interface (GUI). Please have a look at this file with the GUI. \n",
    "The approach was quite simple, I have added all the analysed compounds that are found in the table as primary entities in the dissolved phase (*diss*). We define the pH as a fixed logact and we assume that water is the solute phase with a fixed logactivity of 0. We do not select any minerals on the *Phases & Reactions* tab, because we do not allow for any precipitation. We assume that the water samples are stored in bottles with out any gas-phase (head space), we set the gasvolume to be zero on the *Variables* tab. This chemical system is defined in *chemistry1.inp*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to illustrate the steps, we will analyse two water samples: S1 and F1. Please note that the concentrations are given in $\\text{mg/l}$ and the temperature in $^\\text{o}\\text{C}$, we need to traslate these numbers to $\\text{mol/l}$ and $\\text{K}$ in order to work with Orchestra.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint} Creating the *chemistry.inp* file\n",
    "Using the Orchestra GUI shown in [](#master_species)  we are able to define a system of the primary entities. You do this by selecting the **Chemistry** tab on the right in the ORCHESTRA-COMPOSER window. The **Chemistry** tab shows a number of tabs which fill the *chemistry1.inp* file. We start by selecting tab **Primary entities/ Master Species**. Remember that we select the Master Species in such a way that we can create all other species for our problem. In addition we need to use these species to define the total moles of each master species present in the system (including the amounts of these master species present in the secondary species).\n",

    "In order to run this scenario, we need a different type of calculation than used for step 1. The main difference is that we need to allow Orchestra to precipitate calcite. We need to activate the precipitation reactions in the GUI, which allows Orchestra to add the reactions to the equation set. In addition we need allow our Python script to fix the CO2[g].logact value, instead of defining the HCO3-.tot amount.\n",

We can achieve this by adding a constant to the precipitation reaction of Calcite in the *chemistry.inp* file. In this case we added *deltaSIcalcite* to the file, with a default value of 0. If we set to another value, the model solves an equilibrium for this other value. These changes have been implemented in the *chemistry2.inp* file. We will allow Orchestra to change the pH in order to achieve charge balance.\n",
