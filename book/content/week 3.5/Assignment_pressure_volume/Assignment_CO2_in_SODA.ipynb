    "## Define chemical system: Carbonate, Water and Calcite using the ORCHESTRA-GUI\n",
    "In order to solve a chemical equilibrium problem with pyOrchestra, we need to define our chemical system first. Orchestra defines this system with a number of text files. The most important one is the so-called chemistry input file (*chemistry1.inp*). This file is most easily made using the Orchestra GUI which can be accessed by clicking on the orchestra2023.jar file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the CO2-water system we distinguish three types of scenarios: \n",
    "1. a scenario with a gas-phase with a fixed closed volume. This implies that the pressure in the gas phase will change based on the chemical processes occuring in the system;\n",
    "2. a scenario where the gas pressure is assumed to be constant in a closed volume, this implies that the volume of the system changes based on the chemical processes;\n",
    "3. a scenario where our system is in open contact with the atmosphere, this implies that the partial pressures (and therefore the activities) of the gaseous components do not change as the reactions proceed in our system. This because the volume (and therefore the amount of gaseous species present) is so much larger than our system that we may neglect the changes due to our reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the first tutorial of this week we start with a skeleton problem (a working ORCHESTRA simulation and it is convenient to start with the results from tutorial 1) and then adjust the files step by step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the steps described in Tutorial 1 we created *chemistry_pressure_volume.inp*. The carbonate system we want to analyse is controlled by the following reactions:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\\text{CO}_2\\text{(g)} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} &\\leftrightharpoons \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3^* \\\\\n",

    "$\\text{Ar(g)}$ is used as an inert back ground gas to maintain gas pressure in the case all of the gaseous species in our reaction were to be consumed. \n",
    "\n",

    "|Primary entity|Input Variable|Fix log activity|Log activity|Concentration|Phase|Expression|\n",

    "\n",
    "We have another *chemistry.inp* file in order to calulate the equilibrium when we have a \"open system\" where the water is in contact with a gas phase where the partial pressures are maintained at a constant value. This is the case for a jar open to the atmosphere or a jar in contact with a control system that maintains a constant partial pressure.\n",

    "We follow the same systematic approach as Tutorial 1, which consists of the following standard steps:\n",
    "1. define the domain for our problem\n",
    "2. define the primary species which change during our scenario\n",
    "3. initialize the problem\n",
    "4. run the problem\n",
    "5. process the output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define the domain\n",
    "For this analysis you need to define if the problem is a fixed_pressure, fixed_volume or constant log_activity.\n",
    "You also need to define the volumes of gas a water present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Define the primary species\n",
    "The primary species are as defined above with the ORCHESTRA GUI. Please note that the values required by ORCHESTRA have to be in moles. In order to get moles/liter the volume of water has to be set to 1 liter, and the density of water need to be given as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Initialise the problem \n",
    "The initial condition for our problem will be defined by setting:\n",
    "1. the type of problem (fixed logactivty, volume or pressure)\n",
    "2. the initial conditions (volumes and totals of gas present)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once pyOrchestra is initialized, running a simulation consists of a series of steps where the values of the required set of input variables are passed via *InVARS* to ORCHESTRA, after which a set of corresponding output variables are passed back in *OutVars*. Please note that the type of problem has to be defined as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initialization in Python, we know which variables will be passed through *OutVars* and can be used in *InVars*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code shows how to do this.\n",
    "```{note} \n",
