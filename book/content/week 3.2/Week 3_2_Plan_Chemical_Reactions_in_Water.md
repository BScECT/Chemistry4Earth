## Lecture 1 (Monday): Chemical Equilibria Foundations

**Objectives**
- Introduce geochemical context of reactions in water.  
- Explain thermodynamic equilibrium and the role of activities.  
- Derive equilibrium expressions and apply mass/charge balance.  

**Outline**
1. Motivation: relevance in groundwater and pollution.  
2. System components (aqueous phase, minerals, gases).  
3. Thermodynamics: ΔG, equilibrium concept.  
4. Law of mass action, equilibrium constants (K, logK).  
5. Example: Fluorite–Gypsum–H₂O system.  
6. Balancing and charge/mass balance rules.  
7. Summary discussion: controls on water composition.


### Tutorial 1: Equilibrium Practice

**Goals**
- Understand how the Mass Action Law works;
- Understand why correction for activity is relevant;
- Understand why log transform is useful and how this works 
- Practice with these concepts;

**Activities**
1. Dissolution/precipitation examples (calcite, gypsum).  
2. Determine direction of reaction from Q vs K.  
3. Group balancing exercises.  
4. 10-minute conceptual quiz.

### Self-study After Lecture 1, prepare for Thursday
- Read Ch. 4 (4.1–4.5) from [Appelo and Postma (2004)](https://doi-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/10.1201/9781439833544).
- Prepare one discussion question.


## Lecture 2 (Thursday): Speciation & Natural Waters

**Objectives**
- Solving equilibrium problems. Understanding massbalance and electron balance.  
- Introduce acid-base, complexation, and redox reactions.  
- Interpret carbonate speciation diagrams.  
- Discuss environmental implications (buffering, pH control).

**Outline**
1. Review key equilibrium concepts.  
2. Overview of reaction types.  
3. Carbonate system (CO₂–H₂CO₃–HCO₃⁻–CO₃²⁻).  
4. Speciation and pH dependence.  
5. Applications in natural waters.  
6. Intro to modeling (PHREEQC, Visual MINTEQ).

### Self-study After Lecture 2
- Read Ch. 5 completely.  
- Practice carbonate speciation problems.  
- Complete online self-test.  
- Reflection: *How do chemical reactions control groundwater chemistry?*

---

### Tutorial 2: Speciation Integration

**Goals**
- Connect Chapters 4 & 5 concepts.  
- Apply equilibrium and speciation ideas.  
- Foster conceptual understanding through teamwork.

**Activities**
1. Carbonate equilibrium exercises (log K, pH, species fractions).  
2. Group discussion: effects of CO₂ and temperature.  
3. Optional PHREEQC demo.  
4. Recap quiz + feedback.

## Self study: home work
- Read topics which you find difficult. Reflect on your understanding, prepare questions for teaching staff;
- Create a summary for the week so that you can quickly revise the information when preparing for the exam.
