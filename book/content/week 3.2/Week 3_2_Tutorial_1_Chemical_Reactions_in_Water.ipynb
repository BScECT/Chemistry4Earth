    "By the end of this chapter, you will:\n",
    "- Identify and write relevant aqueous chemical reactions for Earth Science systems.\n",
    "- Apply the **Mass Action Law** and understand activities vs concentrations.\n",
    "- Use **equilibrium constants** and relate them to **Gibbs free energy**.\n",
    "- Understand **standard states** and the meaning of equilibrium.\n",
    "- Transform equilibrium expressions into **logarithmic form** and revisit pH/pOH.\n",

Please note that this chapter explains the concepts using gases. As gases do not contain a charge, activities and concentrations are assumed to be identical. If we assume that the reactions take place in a vessel with fixed volume ($V$), pressure ($P$) and temperature ($T$ we can use the ideal gas law to relate pressure to the number of molecules present in the vessel ($n$). Please note that molar concentration of a compound i is the number of moles this compound i normalized to volume: $m_i = n_i/V$. Using the gas law:\n",
