# Week 4 Electrochemistry
NOT FINISHED
This is a template chapter. It contains random text and a formula to familiarise you with the structure.

$$
\phi(a \bm{v} + b \bm{w}) = a \phi(\bm{v}) + b \phi(\bm{w}).

## Introduction

This week we will study electrochemistry: redox. We will use chapter 18 from Tro, Chemistry: A molecular approach. Just as in the previous 3 weeks, you will work through the material yourself, with an instructor avaiolable during most of the scheduled self-study and excercise classes. The lectures on Monday will walk you through the main concepts of the chapter, and give you the opportunity to ask some clarifying questions based on your pre-reading of the material. Then you will go to the excercises given at the end of the chapter. More details on this below. On Thursday, any remaining material will be briefly discussed if needed, and if any questions stood out during the practice hours on Monday those will be adressed as well. To complete your learnings of the week, you will test your progress with a set of problems integrating the different concepts you learned. This will also give you an indication of what is expected of you in the exam. 

This weeks learning will help prepare you for week 8, where we use the principles of redox chemistry to draw Pourbaix diagrams, or Eh-pH, or pE-pH diagrams. These are very useful to graphically represent the stable phases (in the liquid or solid) at a certain combination of reodx potential and pH. These types of diagrams, also referred to as stability diagrams, are commonly used in geochemistry.
