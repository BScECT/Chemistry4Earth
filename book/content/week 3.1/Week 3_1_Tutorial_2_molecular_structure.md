# Week 3.1, Tutorial 2: Molecule Structures

## Objective
The objective of this tutorial you revisit the structure of an atom, the periodic system, molecules and chemical equations. The content is well described in “Principles of Chemistry: A molecular approach. 3rd Edition by Nivaldo J. Tro” chapters 2 and 3, 7, 8 and 9. 

## Assignment 1: Structure of general chemical species
In this practical you analyze how atoms can react with each other to form other compounds (molecules or species). You need to understand how the periodic table can be used to obtain the number of electrons in the outer shell and why certain elements and species like to form ions. 

You will use the chapters from Tro to understand the structure of an atom, how the core is built up of neutrons and protons, how the electrons are distributed over the atoms shells, and how the periodic system is related to the number of protons and electrons. What this implies for ions, and metals... 

You need to give the electron configuration for all the elements in the following list of compounds. Try to figure out which of these elements from covalent bonds and ionic bonds, and what the species are involved in forming these compounds:

$\text{H}_2$, $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$, $\text{CO}_2$, $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$, $\text{FeOOH}$, $\text{CCl}_4$, $\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$, $\text{S}_2$, $\text{H}_2$, $\text{S}$, $\text{SO}_2$, $\text{H}_2\text{SO}_3$, $\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$, $\text{Al[OH]}_3$, $\text{H}_2\text{SiO}_3$ and $\text{NO}$. 

You need to write the structure of these compounds as Lewis structures (stick models). Please mark all outer electrons in the structure.

## Assignment 2: Structure of a mineral
Select one of the crystalline minerals from your mineralogy class. Try to create the lewis structures for the building blocks of your selected mineral. For example, one of the general building blocks of a mineral are aluminium or silcium oxygen tetrahedra: $\text{[AlO}_4\text{]}^{-5}$ or $\text{[SiO}_4\text{]}^{-4}$.

Please explain how the charge in the crystal structure is balanced.
