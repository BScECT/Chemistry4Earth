# Week 3.1: Chemistry and Earth Sciences
## Learning Goals

By the end of the week, students should be able to:

1. Students understand the planning of the course and what will be expected from them;
2. Obtain a first understanding of the relevance of Chemistry for Earth Sciences;
3. Understand the distribution of the elements in the galaxy, the solar system and earth;
4. Understand the periodic system and analyze the rol of individual elements in a molecule.

## Lecture 1 (Monday): Introduction and get to know the teachers

**Outline**
- Who will teach this class.  
- What is this class about?  
- What do we expect from you? 
- Get started with python.
- Topic for this week: the composition of galaxy and the composition of the earth and where the elements can be found.
    - [*The composition of the Earth*](https://cen-acs-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/physical-chemistry/geochemistry/Periodic-Graphics-composition-Earth/103/web/2025/06)
    - [Abundance of elements in Earth's crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust)
    - [Abundance of the chemical elements in the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements)
- The periodic table of Elements

    
### Tutorial 1: Getting Started

**Activities**
- Install the python environment for this class on your computer;
- Install pyOrchestra in this environment;
- Install the VSCode IDE on your computer
- Download and run the notebook for the lecture in week 3.2.

### Self study 1: after tutorial
**Self-study**
- Browse the information from Tro: Chapters 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9. Read the assignment for Thursday.


## Lecture 2 (Thursday): the Periodic System: structure of the atom, molecules and chemical formulas

**Objectives**
- Refresh knowledge from High School.  
- Understand, and recognize main species.  



### Tutorial 2: Structure of Molecules

**Outline**
1. Use information from Tro to analyze how electrons are shared among elements in different types of molecules.
2. Understand the difference between covalent bonds and ionic bonds.
3. Explain molecules using "stick" structures and Lewis structures.
4. 20 minute test, exam level question


### Self study 2: after tutorial
- Read Chapter 1 from [Appelo and Postma (2004)](https://doi-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/10.1201/9781439833544).
- Scan Chapter 4.1 to 4.5 from [Appelo and Postma (2004)](https://doi-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/10.1201/9781439833544).  
- Browse Tro chapters 14, 15, 16 and 17


## Self study: home work


- Read topics which you find difficult. Reflect on your understanding, prepare questions for teaching staff;
- Create a summary for the week so that you can quickly revise the information when preparing for the exam.
